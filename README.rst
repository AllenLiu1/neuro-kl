neuro-kl
======

`neuro-kl` contains a Python module and Matlab functions to compute an estimate
of the entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence of distribution of simultaneously
recorded neural data.

The KL is estimated using a Bayesian method designed to deal with
relatively large distributions (2^16 elements), and is described in the
supplementary material of the paper

    Berkes, P., Orban, G., Lengyel, M., and Fiser, J. (2011).
